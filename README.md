Project Overview
This project analyzes the unemployment rate in the United States from 2010 to 2021 based on various factors, including education, ethnicity, gender, and country-level trends. Using statistical analysis and data visualization, we identify patterns and insights into unemployment trends.
Dataset Information
The datasets used for this analysis are obtained from Kaggle:

US Unemployment Dataset (2010-2020)
Unemployment Analysis Dataset

Conclusion
Using the US Unemployment Dataset and additional unemployment data, we identified key patterns in unemployment trends across various demographics. The analysis provides a clear picture of unemployment trends, highlighting major changes over the years, particularly the spike in 2020. Further in-depth analysis can be conducted for future insights.
